Let's revisit our lucky_number function. We want to change it, so that instead of printing the message, it returns the message. 
This way, the calling line can print the message, or do something else with it if needed. 
Fill in the blanks to complete the code to make it work.

Q2(Not quite. Remember to use the str() function to convert
numbers into strings when printing them with text, and to
call the function with just one parameter, then accept the
return value into a new variable.)

def lucky_number(name):
  number = len(name) * 9
  result = "Hello " + name + ". Your lucky number is " + str(number)
  return result
	    
print(lucky_number("Kay"))
print(lucky_number("Cameron"))
