The is_positive function should return True if the number received is positive and False if it isn't. 
Can you fill in the gaps to make that happen?

def is_positive(number):
  if number > 0:
    return True
  else:
    return False

is_positive(-5) returned False
is_positive(0) returned False
is_positive(13) returned True

Well done, you! You're starting to
master conditional expressions!
